# VGG16-Net-Using-Tensorflow
Implementation of vgg16 network

# Overview

In this repertoire, I have implemented Vgg16 network that is a convolutional neural network model proposed by K. Simonyan and A. Zisserman from the University of Oxford in the paper "Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition". It performs on the dataset: 16 Flowers, which presents 17 category flower dataset with 80 images for each class. The flowers chosen are some common flowers in the UK. The images have large scale, pose and light variations and there are also classes with large varations of images within the class and close similarity to other classes.
